# Deploying a Fully Serverless Architecture Using AWS, Terraform, and GitHub Actions

## Introduction

Serverless computing has revolutionized how developers deploy and manage applications. It removes the overhead of provisioning, scaling, and maintaining servers, allowing teams to focus solely on writing and deploying code. Originally centered around Function as a Service (FaaS) with offerings like AWS Lambda, serverless has evolved into a broader ecosystem of managed services, including databases, storage, and networking.

This project demonstrates a practical implementation of a fully serverless architecture using AWS services, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) through Terraform, and CI/CD automation via GitHub Actions. We will use a Node.js Cloud Native API as our application, deploying it on AWS serverless infrastructure.

## Problem Statement

The client needs an API that:
- Scales automatically with demand without managing infrastructure.
- Is cost-efficient, with no server maintenance.
- Uses serverless AWS services to minimize operational overhead.
- Has secure handling of sensitive credentials.
- Ensures automated deployment using CI/CD pipelines.

The API will be a Node.js-based application that stores structured data in a serverless database (Aurora Serverless) and static files (images) in S3. Credentials like database passwords will be securely managed with AWS Secrets Manager.

## Solution Overview

To address the client’s needs, we’ll develop a fully serverless architecture on AWS, deploying a Node.js Cloud Native API. Terraform will be used to define and provision the infrastructure, and GitHub Actions will automate the CI/CD pipeline.

### Key AWS Services:
- **AWS API Gateway**: Manages HTTP requests and routes them to the Lambda functions.
- **AWS Lambda**: Executes business logic without the need to manage servers.
- **Aurora Serverless**: Automatically scales and manages the API's database layer.
- **AWS S3**: Stores binary image data uploaded through the API.
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Manages sensitive data like database credentials.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitors application logs and metrics.
- **Route 53**: Handles DNS and routing for the API.
- **VPC and Endpoints**: Ensures secure communication between AWS services.

### Architecture Diagram

The architecture includes the following key components:
- **API Gateway**: Receives requests and routes them to AWS Lambda.
- **Lambda Functions**: Executes the API code within a VPC.
- **Aurora Serverless**: Hosts the relational database (MySQL) for storing user and product data.
- **S3**: Stores image files for products.
- **Secrets Manager**: Manages and rotates database credentials.
- **VPC**: Provides a private network for secure access to services.
- **Route 53**: Manages DNS routing for the API.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates CI/CD for code deployments.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Prerequisites
Before diving into the infrastructure setup, ensure you have the following installed and set up:
- **AWS CLI**: To interact with AWS services.
- **Terraform**: For infrastructure as code.
- **Node.js and npm**: For building and testing the API locally.
- **GitHub Account**: To store the source code and set up CI/CD workflows.
- **AWS Account**: For provisioning the necessary resources.

### Step 2: Terraform Configuration Files
We’ll use Terraform to define and provision the infrastructure, ensuring that the architecture is reproducible and maintainable.

#### 2.1 VPC Setup (`vpc.tf`)
This file defines a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with both public and private subnets to deploy the Lambda functions and other services securely.
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Create VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "main_vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_support = true
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  tags = {
    Name = "serverless-vpc"
  }
}

# Create public subnet
resource "aws_subnet" "public_subnet" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main_vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  availability_zone = "us-east-1a"
  tags = {
    Name = "public-subnet"
  }
}

# Create private subnet for Lambda
resource "aws_subnet" "private_subnet" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main_vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.2.0/24"
  availability_zone = "us-east-1a"
  tags = {
    Name = "private-subnet"
  }
}
```

#### 2.2 Security Groups (`security_groups.tf`)
Define security groups to control access to the Lambda functions, Aurora Serverless, and other resources.
```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "lambda_sg" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main_vpc.id
  ingress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "lambda-security-group"
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "aurora_sg" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main_vpc.id

  ingress {
    from_port   = 3306
    to_port     = 3306
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "aurora-security-group"
  }
}
```

#### 2.3 AWS Lambda and API Gateway (`lambda_api.tf`)
This configuration deploys the Lambda function and configures API Gateway to route incoming HTTP requests to the Lambda.
```hcl
resource "aws_lambda_function" "api_lambda" {
  function_name = "api-lambda"
  runtime       = "nodejs14.x"
  role          = aws_iam_role.lambda_exec_role.arn
  handler       = "index.handler"

  filename      = "function.zip"
  source_code_hash = filebase64sha256("function.zip")

  vpc_config {
    security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.lambda_sg.id]
    subnet_ids         = [aws_subnet.private_subnet.id]
  }

  environment {
    variables = {
      DB_SECRET_ARN = aws_secretsmanager_secret.database_creds.arn
      BUCKET_NAME   = aws_s3_bucket.api_bucket.bucket
    }
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "api-lambda"
  }
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_rest_api" "api_gateway" {
  name = "serverless-api"
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_resource" "user_resource" {
  rest_api_id = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.api_gateway.id
  parent_id   = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.api_gateway.root_resource_id
  path_part   = "v1/user"
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_method" "get_user_method" {
  rest_api_id   = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.api_gateway.id
  resource_id   = aws_api_gateway_resource.user_resource.id
  http_method   = "GET"
  authorization = "NONE"
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_integration" "lambda_integration" {
  rest_api_id = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.api_gateway.id
  resource_id = aws_api_gateway_resource.user_resource.id
  http_method = aws_api_gateway_method.get_user_method.http_method
  type        = "AWS_PROXY"
  integration_http_method = "POST"
  uri = aws_lambda_function.api_lambda.invoke_arn
}
```

#### 2.4 Aurora Serverless (`aurora.tf`)
Aurora Serverless is set up to provide a scalable MySQL database.
```hcl
resource "aws_rds_cluster" "aurora" {
  cluster_identifier      = "aurora-cluster"
  engine                  = "aurora-mysql"
  master_username         = "admin"
  master_password         = "password"
  skip_final_snapshot     = true
  engine_mode             = "serverless"
  scaling_configuration {
    min_capacity = 2
    max_capacity = 16
    auto_pause   = true
    seconds_until_auto_pause = 300
  }
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.aurora_sg.id]
  db_subnet_group_name   = aws_db_subnet_group.main.name
}
```

### Step 3: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

The CI/CD pipeline automates deployments whenever new code is merged into the repository.

#### GitHub Actions Workflow (`main.yml`)
```yaml
name: Deploy Serverless API

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name:

 Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Deploy to AWS Lambda
      run: |
        npm run build
        zip -r function.zip .
        aws lambda update-function-code --function-name api-lambda --zip-file fileb://function.zip
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we successfully implemented a fully serverless architecture that meets the client's needs for scalability, security, and automation. By using AWS serverless services, such as Lambda, API Gateway, Aurora Serverless, and S3, we created a highly efficient environment where the API can automatically scale based on demand without requiring manual intervention or server management. This ensures optimal performance while maintaining cost-efficiency, as the client only pays for the resources they use.

Security was a key consideration, and we integrated AWS Secrets Manager to securely store sensitive information like database credentials, ensuring that they are protected and rotated automatically. By deploying all services within a VPC, we further enhanced the security of the system, creating a private and controlled environment.

In addition, we implemented continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions, which automates the deployment process. This provides the client with a seamless workflow, where any code updates are automatically tested and deployed, minimizing downtime and allowing for rapid iteration.

This serverless solution not only reduces operational complexity and cost but also positions the client for future growth, offering them a flexible, scalable, and secure platform for their Node.js Cloud Native API.
